# Port of TwoStepsAuthenticator to .NET Standard 1.6

This is a port of https://github.com/glacasa/TwoStepsAuthenticator by https://github.com/glacasa to the .NET Standard 1.6 profile. 

All coding credits go to https://github.com/glacasa - I simply ported it because of a need to target this across a Xamarin & .NET 4.5 project. I figured I wouldn't be the only with this requirement, so I put it in this repo.  

.NET Standard 1.6 profile-based libs can be targetted by .NET Core, .NET, Xamarin, ... so if you have a need for this, feel free to use it.
